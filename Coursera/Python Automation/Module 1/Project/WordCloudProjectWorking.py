# The uploader widget saved the contents of your uploaded file into a string object named *file_contents* that your word cloud script can process. This was a lot of preliminary work, but you are now ready to begin your script. 

# Write a function in the cell below that iterates through the words in *file_contents*, removes punctuation, and counts the frequency of each word.  Oh, and be sure to make it ignore word case, words that do not contain all alphabets and boring words like "and" or "the".  Then use it in the `generate_from_frequencies` function to generate your very own word cloud!
# <br><br>
# **Hint:** Try storing the results of your iteration in a dictionary before passing them into wordcloud via the `generate_from_frequencies` function.
